### Queues

* [x] Enumerate and explain the methods that are part of a **pure queue** interface
* [x] Define FIFO and explain how it relates to a queue
* [x] The [`Queue<E>`](http://javadoc.taylorial.com/java.base/util/Queue.html) interface has multiple methods for insertion, removal, and accessing the front element.  Describe how these methods differ.
* [x] Describe the design flaw found in the `Queue<E>` interface found in the Java Collections Framework
* [x] Implement a class that provides an efficient implementation of the pure queue interface using a `LinkedList<E>`
* [x] Explain why an `ArrayList<E>` is not an appropriate choice when implementing a pure queue interface
* [x] Explain how a circular queue differs from a standard queue
* [x] Implement a class that provides an efficient implementation of a circular queue using an array
* [x] Implement small software systems that use one or more queue data structures
* [x] List at least two examples of when it makes sense to use a `Queue`

### Recursion

* [x] For a given input, determine how many times a recursive method will call itself
* [x] Explain the role of the base case and recursive step in recursive algorithms
* [x] Use recursion to traverse a list
* [x] Use recursion to search a sorted array
* [x] Use the `compareTo()` method from the `Comparable` interface to determine which of two objects is bigger
* [ ] Write a generic class which implements the `Comparable` interface appropriately
* [x] Understand and apply recursion in algorithm development
