## Week 5

### Queues

* [ ] Enumerate and explain the methods that are part of a **pure queue** interface
* [ ] Define FIFO and explain how it relates to a queue
* [ ] The [`Queue<E>`](http://javadoc.taylorial.com/java.base/util/Queue.html) interface has multiple methods for insertion, removal, and accessing the front element.  Describe how these methods differ.
* [ ] Describe the design flaw found in the `Queue<E>` interface found in the Java Collections Framework
* [ ] Implement a class that provides an efficient implementation of the pure queue interface using a `LinkedList<E>`
* [ ] Explain why an `ArrayList<E>` is not an appropriate choice when implementing a pure queue interface
* [ ] Explain how a circular queue differs from a standard queue
* [ ] Implement a class that provides an efficient implementation of a circular queue using an array
* [ ] Implement small software systems that use one or more queue data structures
* [ ] List at least two examples of when it makes sense to use a `Queue`

### Recursion

* [ ] For a given input, determine how many times a recursive method will call itself
* [ ] Explain the role of the base case and recursive step in recursive algorithms
* [ ] Use recursion to traverse a list
* [ ] Use recursion to search a sorted array
* [ ] Use the `compareTo()` method from the `Comparable` interface to determine which of two objects is bigger
* [ ] Write a generic class which implements the `Comparable` interface appropriately
* [ ] Understand and apply recursion in algorithm development
