## Week 6

### Announcements

### Binary Trees

* [x] Use the following terms to describe nodes in a tree: root, children, parent, sibling, leaf, ancestor, descendent
* [x] Recognize empty trees and contents after any branch to be trees themselves, specifically subtrees
* [x] Define node level recursively, starting with level 1 at the root. Define height as the maximum node level.
* [x] Define binary tree (contrasted with a general tree) and explain the use of common types of binary trees: expression trees, Huffman trees, binary search trees
* [x] Explain the criteria for binary trees that are full, perfect, and complete
* [x] Explain preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal of trees using words and figures
* [x] Explain the significance of each of these orders when applied to expression trees

### Binary Tree Implementation

* [ ] Develop a `BinaryTree<E>` class with no-arg, one-arg (root node) and 3-arg (root node as well as left and right subtrees) constructors
* [ ] Implement `BinaryTree<E>` methods: get{Left,Right}Subtree, isLeaf, and preOrderTraverse/toString methods
